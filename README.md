# Social Network API

## Description

This project details the back-end of a social media website using MongoDB and Mongoose. Users can be created, updated, and deleted. Each user can post thoughts, and each thought can have reactions attached to it. Thoughts can be updated and deleted, and reactions can be deleted as well.

## Usage/Preview

Users can get started with this application by first cloning the repository. Then, there is a quick set-up that involves running `npm run seed` to seed the starting data and then running `npm run start` to get the server up and running. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests can then be made while traversing the database, preferably using software like Insomnia.
